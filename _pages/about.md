I am Rishabh Jain — a 4th‑year B.Tech student in Engineering & Computational Mechanics at **IIT Delhi** (CGPA 9.03). I work at the intersection of machine learning and engineering: building ML systems that accelerate simulation, enable inverse design, and make complex physics problems tractable. I'm currently preparing applications for MS programs in ML/AI and Computational Engineering (US / Europe) and am open to research internships and collaborations.

# About

I combine classical engineering intuition (CFD, FEA, surrogate modelling) with modern ML techniques (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, GANs, RAG pipelines) to tackle high‑cost, high‑value design and prediction problems. My research and internship experience includes building surrogate models for design exploration, prediction of aerodynamic coefficients from geometry, explainable AI for seismology problems, and productionizing small ML systems (edge deployment with TensorFlow Lite, retrieval‑augmented systems with LangGraph).

# Selected experience (high level — not a CV)

* **IBM Research (Gurgaon)** — Built a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and embedding/ chunking experiments for Root Cause Analysis using Granite LLMs. (May–Jul 2025)
* **National University of Singapore (Prof. Gianmarco Mengaldo)** — Explainable AI for earthquake prediction; time‑series models and post‑hoc interpretability. (May–Jul 2024)
* **Siemens Energy** — Surrogate modelling & ML in CFD workflows for gas turbine auxiliaries. (Dec 2024–Jan 2025)
* **Selected projects:** Intelligent waste‑segregation CNN deployed on Raspberry Pi; RegDGCNN / PaDGAN work for parameterized aerodynamic datasets; inverse design with surrogate physics models and active learning.

# Research interests
