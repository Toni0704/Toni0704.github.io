I am Rishabh Jain — a 4th‑year B.Tech student in Engineering & Computational Mechanics at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi**. I work at the intersection of machine learning and engineering: building ML systems that accelerate simulation, enable inverse design, and make complex physics problems tractable. I'm currently preparing applications for MS programs in ML/AI and Computational Engineering (US / Europe) and am open to research internships and collaborations.

<!-- # About

I combine classical engineering intuition (CFD, FEA, surrogate modelling) with modern ML techniques (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, GANs, RAG pipelines) to tackle high‑cost, high‑value design and prediction problems. My research and internship experience includes building surrogate models for design exploration, prediction of aerodynamic coefficients from geometry, explainable AI for seismology problems, and productionizing small ML systems (edge deployment with TensorFlow Lite, retrieval‑augmented systems with LangGraph). -->

# Outside the lab

I captained my hostel table‑tennis team, serve as Convener of CAIC (department student body), and play the guitar. I enjoy hackathons and have a soft spot for hacky, reproducible engineering demos.
