description: "Surrogate modelling and ML in CFD workflows for gas turbine auxiliaries."
---

During this internship, I conducted research and developed a comprehensive proposal for integrating machine learning, particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), into Computational Fluid Dynamics workflows for gas turbine auxiliary systems. The work explored the potential of ML models to provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional CFD solvers, with a specific focus on the lube oil degasification problem.

**Key Contributions:**
- Researched the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks for CFD in gas turbine auxiliaries
- Analyzed the lube oil degasification problem and proposed PINN-based solutions
- Explored integration of physical laws into ML models to enhance simulation accuracy
- Investigated potential computational efficiency improvements over traditional solvers
- Developed framework for validating PINN models against high-fidelity simulations for turbine-related processes
