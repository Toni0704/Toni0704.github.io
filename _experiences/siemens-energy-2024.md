description: "Surrogate modelling and ML in CFD workflows for gas turbine auxiliaries."
---

During this internship, I worked on surrogate modeling and machine learning applications in computational fluid dynamics workflows for gas turbine auxiliary systems. The work involved building ML models to accelerate design exploration and predict performance metrics from simulation data.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed surrogate models to replace expensive CFD simulations
- Integrated ML workflows into existing design pipelines
- Validated model accuracy against high-fidelity simulations
