During this internship I built a RAG pipeline integrating embeddings, chunking strategies, and evaluation metrics for information retrieval applied to system logs.

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed and implemented embedding strategies for technical documentation
- Developed chunking experiments to optimize retrieval accuracy
- Evaluated RAG performance using Granite LLMs
